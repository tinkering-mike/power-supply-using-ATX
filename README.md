## Making of a Benchtop DC Power Supply

I was inspired by several YouTube videos about making a power supply out of a cheap computer ATX power supply which already gives several DC voltage levels.

### Specifications

* Use the voltages available from the ATX power supply
  * +3.3v 18A,  will limit to 10A with fuse
  * +5v 9A, will limit to 8A with fuse
  * +12v 11A, will limit to 10A with fuse
  * -12v 200mA, no fuse needed
  * +12v 4.5A, will be used for converter below
* Use buck/boost converter module, with a range from 2v to 24v while using an input voltage of 12v
* The voltage converter also has a current limitation control, so it can be used as a constant current source. Will limit to 3A with fuse
* Use voltmeter/ammeter modules to show the voltage and current for all voltage sources except -12v
